Increasing Health Problems and Stress Stress and various health problems are occurring on a daily basis in modern society, and these problems are associated with poor sleep quality, and lack of sleep negatively affects physical and mental health, and it is becoming increasingly important to recover your body and mind through sleep and rest. In modern society, digital healthcare that can restore sleep quality has become possible thanks to the items described below. Advances in Scientific Research: Sleep analysis through brainwaves has made significant strides in the field of sleep research in recent decades, and it plays an important role in understanding and improving individual sleep patterns. The Importance of Personalized Health Care: Personalized Health Care is being emphasized. Therefore, an application is needed to measure brain waves and provide advice accordingly to tell you which type of sleep pattern is most ideal for an individual.

Mainly focused on **insomniacs**.
Everyone who wants to make their own sleep images and write their own sleep diary.


### üåÜ Main Functions
*****
**Writing a Sleep Diary**
Users suffering from insomnia record their sleep patterns and quality in text format throughout the day.

**Checking Factors Affecting Sleep**
While there are various factors that can influence sleep, in our project, we prompt users to input their caffeine intake, exercise routine, and alcohol consumption as key elements.

**Providing Sleep Solutions**
We analyze the user-input sleep factors along with sleep data obtained from Brid.zzz to offer a personalized sleep solution.

**Image-Generating AI**
We utilize the image-generating AI, DALL-E.
Input the sleep diary text and the user's sleep state data into the prompt.
Through this process, a picture representing the user's sleep state for the day is generated, allowing the user to visually assess how their sleep was at a glance.

**Data Analysis and Machine Learning**
We provide insights into the most significant factors influencing the quality of a user's sleep through correlation analysis.
Using machine learning, we predict the quality of sleep based on changes in each factor, offering a personalized sleep solution tailored to the user.
