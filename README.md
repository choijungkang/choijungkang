## üåÜ Abstract
Increasing Health Problems and Stress Stress and various health problems are occurring on a daily basis in modern society, and these problems are associated with poor sleep quality, and lack of sleep negatively affects physical and mental health, and it is becoming increasingly important to recover your body and mind through sleep and rest. In modern society, digital healthcare that can restore sleep quality has become possible thanks to the items described below. 

**Advances in Scientific Research**: Sleep analysis through brainwaves has made significant strides in the field of sleep research in recent decades, and it plays an important role in understanding and improving individual sleep patterns. 

**The Importance of Personalized Health Care**: Personalized Health Care is being emphasized. Therefore, an application is needed to measure brain waves and provide advice accordingly to tell you which type of sleep pattern is most ideal for an individual. 

**Technology Innovation and Utilization**: Technology innovation allows users to easily collect sleep data and receive personalized health information. Sleep management applications using this help promote healthy lifestyles for users.

## üåÜ Introduction
Sleep is an important physiological process that greatly affects our health and quality of life. Bad sleep quality can be associated with stress, depression, anxiety, excessive fatigue, poor concentration, and physical health problems. Therefore, it is very important to measure and improve the quality of sleep. Against this backdrop, it is important to understand the relationship between sleep quality and brain waves and to create applications that help correct sleep patterns. 

In fact, we found several sleep diary writing platforms for people suffering from sleep disorders. But most of the applications came in a rigid format, and there were even applications that provided only a role as a diary without even the ability to analyze sleep. We wanted to **create a systematic sleep analysis** and an application that helps users keep writing their sleep diaries without getting bored. So, We used **Image creation AI and Brid.zzz** to make this happen.

LG electronic released Brid.zzz for user's mental care and sleep care. Brid.zzz recognizes the brain waves when the user sleeps and provides an analysis of them. We will ask the **image-generating AI to provide relevant images by combining this data with the qualitative data entered by the user**. When the picture is created, the user can receive **the sleep state as a visual image** rather than a text, which stimulates the visual and makes it more interesting than before to write a sleep diary.

## üåÜ Target Users
Mainly focused on **insomniacs**.

Everyone who wants to make their own sleep images and write their own sleep diary.

## üåÜ Main Functions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Writing a Sleep Diary

Users suffering from insomnia record their sleep patterns and quality in text format throughout the day.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Factors Affecting Sleep

While there are various factors that can influence sleep, in our project, we prompt users to input their caffeine intake, exercise routine, and alcohol consumption as key elements.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Providing Sleep Solutions

We analyze the user-input sleep factors along with sleep data obtained from Brid.zzz to offer a personalized sleep solution.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Image-Generating AI

We utilize the image-generating AI, DALL-E.
Input the sleep diary text and the user's sleep state data into the prompt.
Through this process, a picture representing the user's sleep state for the day is generated, allowing the user to visually assess how their sleep was at a glance.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis and Machine Learning

We provide insights into the most significant factors influencing the quality of a user's sleep through correlation analysis.
Using machine learning, we predict the quality of sleep based on changes in each factor, offering a personalized sleep solution tailored to the user.
